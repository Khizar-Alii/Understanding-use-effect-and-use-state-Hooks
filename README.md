I delved into the powerful world of hooks, specifically useState and useEffect, which are fundamental hooks in React for managing state and side effects.

I started by implementing a counter example using the useState hook, where I created a simple counter component that increments or decrements a counter value based on user interactions. This helped me grasp the concept of local state management with hooks, and how useState allows for efficient state updates in functional components.

Next, I explored the useEffect hook, which enables handling side effects, such as fetching data from an API, in functional components. I created a window width component that dynamically displays the current window width using the useEffect hook to listen for resize events and update the state accordingly. This helped me understand how to use useEffect to manage side effects in a declarative and efficient manner.

To further solidify my understanding, I implemented a fetching data example using the useState and useEffect hooks together. I fetched data from an API and displayed it in a string type component, where I could dynamically update and manipulate the data using state management with hooks.

Throughout the project, I learned how hooks revolutionize state management and side effect handling in functional components, providing a cleaner and more concise way to write React code. I also gained a deeper understanding of the principles and best practices of using useState and useEffect, and how they enhance the scalability and maintainability of React applications.

Overall, this project has been an insightful journey into understanding useState and useEffect hooks in React, and I'm excited to apply this knowledge to my future projects. If you're interested in learning more about hooks in React, this project is a great starting point!
